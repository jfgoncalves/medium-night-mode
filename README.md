medium-night-mode
=================

Modify the colors of medium.com to facilitate reading during bedtime.

This extension inverts the colors of medium.com.
You can trigger the night mode at any time by using the switch in the Medium menu.

With its seamless integration, you can forget about it and enjoy reading Medium.
If you close your browser with the night mode on, it will remember your choice and automatically set it up again. 

The extension has been discontinued, because the Medium team update the design at a very high speed, and I don't have the time to maintain it anymore.
